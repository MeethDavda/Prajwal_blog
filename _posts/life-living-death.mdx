## Living in the present

Recently I came across a video, where the creator tried to live his last 7 days with no regrets, If there is one topic I like that is **Life**, **Living** & **Death**. I really enjoyed that video and It also made me think about my life, it also made me realize that indeed every day can be our last. So why start tomorrow if tomorrow is not guaranteed and "we should take more risks from our dreams, instead of dying with regret" really touched me

Most people think Living in the present is a trendy modern thing, but it is not. It is a profound philosophy of life that can transform the way we experience our existence. It is a way of life, it is a way of thinking, it is a way of being. It is a way of living. It is a way of being happy. It is a way of being free. It is a way of being yourself. It is a way of being alive.

In our fast-paced and constantly connected world, it is very easy to get lost in the rush of daily life and forget the present moment. However, when we take a step back and consider whether we are actually living the life we want, or if we are just following the expectations of the world.

As I sit here typing this blog post, I am constantly reminded of how important it is to live in the present moment. It is so easy to get caught up in our worries, and fears about the future or dwells on the past. But what about the now? What about this very moment that we are in right now?

For me, Living in the present means being fully engaged at the moment, not worrying about the past or future. It means taking time to appreciate the little things in life and taking time to reflect on my thoughts and feelings, rather than just rushing through life which helps me to break free from the **RAT RACE**.

Let's be real, it's not always practical to completely stop worrying about the future. The key is to find a balance between planning for the future and enjoying the present moment.

Believe me, Living in the present is super hard, especially when we have a never-ending to-do list and a constant barrage of notifications from our smartphones. But let's be real, we've all had those moments where we're scrolling through Instagram, and suddenly realize an hour has passed and then we feel guilty for wasting time.

_But hey, maybe that hour of mindless scrolling was just what we needed to recharge our batteries and live in the present… Okay, maybe not, but let's pretend it was._

It's also important to have goals and aspirations. But we should also remember to enjoy the journey and appreciate the present moment. Life is too short to constantly be worrying about the future or dwelling on the past.

"Maybe we should focus more on being instead of becoming", we should listen to more of what our heart wants, rather than what the world wants and maybe we should make more chances of our dream instead of dying with regrets

So, take a deep breath, let go of worries and fears, and embrace the present moment. You might just find that life becomes a lot more joyful and meaningful when you do.

ps: all these are just emotional rants :)
