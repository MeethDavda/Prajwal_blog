Today I went to eat Davanagere Benne Dose, As it had been a long time, I ate Benne. Dose and the weather was appetizing to eat a hot burnt crispy Dose.

I took my Activa and went to my regular Dvg-Benne- Dose, I know the taste of Original Davanagere Benne. Dose is irreplaceable in Bengaluru. But this. Dose’s taste was the closest to the Original Davangere Benne. Dose.

But now, I am not talking about the taste Comparison, It is a Talk for another time.

To give you a small description about the hotel, It is almost 5 ft Wide and is around 25ft long, Basically a small Hotel. It is being run by a couple from North Karnataka. They have 2 children as well.

When I was devouring the scrumptious Benne Dose, I observed that slippers of the owners were placed outside, I asked them why ? This is what they told me,

```

It is a proverb saying that We musn’t wear Footwears inside the temple, For us this hotel is the temple, It has given us Food, Home to live, Clothes to wear. We respect the hotel as much as we can..

I was awestruck listening, WOW they have somuch respect to a building.

We Indians worship even small thing if we belive enough in them.

It’s so beautiful to observe such small things in our lives.
