## Automating Your Postman Tests - 1

Postman is a collaboration platform for API development.
Postman's features simplify each step of building an API and streamline collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster.

This Post will be a Two part series, where we will be automating our Postman tests using the Postman API.
In this first part, we'll see about writing some **manual tests** in Postman, inspect responses, create workflows, create **collection** and a test suite
In the Second part we'll see how **CI/CD** pipeline can be setup for running the tests automatically.

This article requires you to have a prequestiste basic understanding of how HTTP/HTTPS works, Methods of HTTP, and how to perform simple GET and POST requests.

Postman needs a live HTTP server to process its requests. For this , we'll use one of my starter express backend setup with database, which is available [here](https://github.com/Prajwalprakash3722/express-ts-backend).

lets clone the starter application, install the necessary dependencies & start the server.

```bash

curl -4 localhost:5000

```

We should see a response like this

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "message": "Hello from the Server"
}
```

Let's start using postman now :)

The backend starter template has a few routes setup, which we can use to test our postman tests.
