## learning_rust[0]

After a heated up discussion with myself & my brain about which static typed langauge to learn,
I was thinking about learning `Go` & `Rust` for a long time but I was not sure which one to learn first,
I finally decided to learn Rust first because I think it is more suitable for my current skill level.

What do I mean by that? I mean that I am not a beginner in programming but I am not an expert either,

But I have a fair understanding of programming concepts & I have a good understanding of functional programming.
I like tinkering with operating systems, processes, threads, etc..
Curious about how memory management work under the hood.

So I thought `Rust` is a good fit for me, I am not sure if I am right or not but I will find out soon.

Let's start with the basics,
I am going to learn Rust by following the official manual [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).

Imma try to write a post for 3 chapter each time, so I can keep track of my progress and can share my experience.

PS: This is what motivated more to learn Rust xD; <br/>
`In most situations, we’ll lead you to the correct version of any code that doesn’t compile.`

## Some Intresting things about Rust I found when I was pouring through the web

- Rust’s unofficial Mascot is an orange crab named Ferris
- Karen Rustad Tölva drew the mascot, and Rust is part of her name.(Credit: Reddit)
