**About the authors**

Robert Kiyosaki

Kiyosaki is best known for his book Rich Dad, Poor Dad, the #1 New York Times bestseller. Kiyosaki followed with Rich Dad’s CASHFLOW Quadrant and Rich Dad’s Guide to Investing. He has now had at least a dozen books published. A partial list of his books is included below.

**My Opinion**:

When I started to read this book, I thought The cover page has authors photo, I was judgemental about this book. I think I was right in some way because he makes real estate sound so easy where it is not so easy. So, while this book gives you such excellent advice as “learn from failure”, “make profitable deals”, and “work hard for yourself”, it doesn’t actually give you a system or method to make money.

He started to make counterfeit money with a goal to become rich at the age of 9 indeed we can say that he had a great mindset. But this book tells you that you have to learn financial management. where ASSETS are required and LIABILITIES must be avoided. (repeatedly)

This book is clearly directed towards the people who are not smart enough to realize that they should ‘work hard and not give up’ if they want to succeed, but who are smart enough to be able to figure all the rest of the logistics out by themselves.

It encourages you to invest in real estate, and there if you make a loss it teaches how to be not sad about losing the money instead of taking it as a lesson for future investments. It gives you simple explanations of how money works. It will not give you any trading tips, but it helps you understand the things no one teaches us in the school or at home. The financial insights aid you to take action, and be your boss.
