You could hear the baby’s cries all over the hospital as soon as the doctor slapped the baby’s butt,
I saw A man running towards the babies ward smiling;
He was a father now. He was eagerly waiting to hear _“Your baby was delivered successfully”_.
As he thought the doctor told him he had conceived a healthy, beautiful boy.
He kissed his wife and son. His family was now complete.
It was the happiest moment of their life in 10 years of marriage.
